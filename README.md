# freecad-izokee-connectors

My first forays into FreeCAD.
While designing my (also first) PCB in KiCAD, I wanted accurate 3D renderings of the izokee brand connectors bought from Amazon.

No idea if this goes anywhere, but at least I got the shape of the 2-pin male connector done.
It's not yet aligned with a footprint in KiCAD, though.
